## Gallery Images

To add your own images to the gallery, place them in this folder and use the following naming convention:
- couple1.jpg
- couple2.jpg
- couple3.jpg
- couple4.jpg
- couple5.jpg

Or you can update the file paths in the index.html file to match your own image names.

Example of how to add images in index.html:
```html
<div class="gallery-item">
    <img src="images/your-image-name.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</div>
```

For best results, use landscape-oriented images (wider than tall) with dimensions around 800x450 pixels.
