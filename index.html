                <h3>My Dearest Love,</h3>
                <p>
                    4 years. Wow. Sometimes it still feels like we just started. I won't pretend I've been the perfect boyfriend — I've scolded you, gotten mad, and said things I wish I could take back. But through all of it, you stayed. You loved me in ways I didn't always know how to return. And that means more to me than I can explain.<br>
                    <br>
                    You've been my calm when I was angry, my comfort when I was lost, and my soft place to land when life got too heavy. You've smiled through my moods, stayed close even when I pushed you away, and kept loving me even when I didn't deserve it. That kind of love — real love — is rare. And I want you to know I see it now, clearly. I feel it.<br>
                    <br>
                    This website is my small way of saying: thank you. For your heart. For your patience. For not giving up on me. For making these 4 years something I'll always hold close.<br>
                    <br>
                    We've made memories, we've grown (a lot), and we've been through things only we understand. I don't know what the future holds, but I know I want to keep walking it with you — with more kindness, more laughter, and more of the love you've always given me.<br>
                    <br> 
                    Happy 4 years, my girl. This one's for you.
                </p>
